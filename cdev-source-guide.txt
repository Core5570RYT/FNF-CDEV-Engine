Since CDEV Engine (finally) getting a rewrite, I've changed how the Source Code folder structure looks like here
(my attempt of organizing things...)

1. [Folder] files - Where to put assets for the engine
   There's 2 folders inside of it for now, which is "assets" and "mods" and i think it's clear enough
   of what are these folders for.
2. [Folder] res   - Every required assets to build the engine, such as app icon.
3. [Folder] src   - Whole source code of the engine.

that's all bye lol
